<h1>Unit 1: Introduction to Data-structrure</h1>

<h2>Data-Structure : </h2>
A Data Structure is a technique to systematically store data so data can be easily and effictively CREATED,ACCESSED,MANAGED. This system collects data values,how they are related to each other,and operation that can be applied to the data.
For example, let's say we have data with values such as Sachine Tendulkar ,40,India.This data is compsed of different data type : string and integer. The name-Sachine Tendulkar, and Location - India,are of string data type, and age is integer.This data can be organized in enterpreneurs' data with their name,location,and age.This collected data can be furture stored in a database as a data structure and used for future operations.
<h1>Type Of Data Struecture</h1>
Data structures are grouped on the type of operations required to perform.The two broad typed of data stucture are:
<ol>
<li>Primitive data structure i.e. build-in data structures</li>
<li>Non-primitive data strucutres or the derived data structures</li>
</ol>
The non-primitive data strucutres can be further classified into linear and nonlinear data structures, which can further based on how the data is stored.The types of trees in the data structure flow.

<h1>Primitive Data Structure</h1>
<ul>
<li>Primitive data structure are basic structures and are directly operated upon by machine instruction.</li>
<li>Primitive data structures have different representations on different computers</li>
<li>Integers,floats,character, and pointer are examples of primitive data structure.</li>
<li>These data types are avilable is most programming language as built in type.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><h6>Integer : </h6>It is a data type which allows all values without fraction part.We can use it for whole numbers.</li>
<li><h6>Float : </h6>It is a data type which for storing fractional numbers.</li>
<li><h6>Charecter : </h6>It is a data type which is used for character values.</li>
<li><h6>Boolean : </h6>Stores the logical values true or false.</li>
